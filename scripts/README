init_data_pp:
    - Does selection of top 30k first
    - Subsets both poly and ribo based on intersected genes
    - Randomly selects n=ribo_samples from poly compendium
    - Concatenated reduced poly compendium with ribo
    - Creates the unbalanced dataset

init_data_ppv2:
    - Poly is reduced first based on n=ribo_samples
    - Poly and ribo are merged first
    - Then selction of op 30k most var genes is done
    - No intersection needed
